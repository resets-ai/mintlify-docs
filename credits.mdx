# Credits & Pricing

Simple, transparent pricing based on usage. Pay only for what you use.

## How Credits Work

Credits are the currency of our platform. Each API operation consumes credits based on complexity.

### Credit Costs

## Credit Optimization

### Search Optimization

<Tip>
  **Smart Credit Usage for Search**

  - Start with smaller result limits to test queries
  - 10-100 results = 1 credit (great for testing)
  - Scale up only when needed
  - Use strctured json selectively
</Tip>

#### Cost-Effective Strategies

```json
// Test with minimal credits
{
  "query": "test query",
  "limitResults": 10  // Only 1 credit
}

// Then scale up
{
  "query": "refined query",
  "limitResults": 100  // 5 credits
}
```

### Extract Optimization

#### Single URL First

Test extraction on one URL before batch processing:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "pageSummary": {
    "schema": { "title": "string" }
  }
}
```
